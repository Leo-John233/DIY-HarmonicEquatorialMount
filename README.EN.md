## DIY Harmonic Equatorial Mount (Field Imaging and Guiding Verified)

Having grown weary of the weight of my EQ3D equatorial mount, I planned to replace it with a lighter and more portable harmonic mount. Commercial harmonic mounts are expensive, especially when compared with the specifications achievable through a DIY build. This project was therefore created to combine precision, portability, and cost-effectiveness without compromising performance.

This project aims to address several critical issues commonly encountered in amateur astronomy equipment:
- The high cost of commercially manufactured mounts.
- A lack of openness and flexibility in design.
- Excessive complexity or incompatibility with individual equipment setups.

The key advantages of this DIY harmonic equatorial mount include:
- 🧰 **Cost-Effective** — The total build cost is under 3,000 RMB, with the cost of custom-machined parts amounting to less than 1,500 RMB.
- 🪶 **Relatively Portable** — Weighs 7.5 kg excluding the latitude base.
- 🏗️ **Easy to Build** — Designed for makers with basic tools.
- 💪 **High Performance** — PHD2 guide satellite imaging test completed.
- ⚠️ **Note on Current Project Status** ⚠️
The project has completed power-on, basic GoTo, guiding, and real-world imaging verification with an actual imaging payload of approximately 13kg. The total RMS of PHD2 during the stable guiding period is typically around 0.4″ to 0.6″, although results may vary depending on the assembly, payload, and environment.

## PHD2 Guiding Test

### Test Configuration

| Item | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- |
| Test software | PHD2 Guiding 2.6.13 |
| Mount connection | OnStep ASCOM |
| Guide camera | ZWO ASI662MC |
| Guide focal length | 200 mm |
| Guide-camera pixel size | 2.9 μm |
| Guide image scale | Approximately 2.99″/px |
| Guide exposure | 0.2 s |
| Actual imaging payload | Approximately 13 kg |
| Test conditions | Light breeze |
| Complete log duration | 52 min 45 s |

### Results Summary

| Test interval | RA RMS | Dec RMS | Total RMS | Notes |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| Stable guiding interval | 0.43″ | 0.50″ | 0.66″ | PHD2 real-time statistics screenshot |
| Complete 52 min 45 s log | 0.45″ | 0.82″ | 0.94″ | Includes dither, settling, and a small number of outlier peaks |

During normal use, the total RMS during stable guiding was typically around 0.4″ to 0.6″. The representative stable screenshot shows a total RMS of 0.66″, while the complete log reached 0.94″ because it includes dither, settling, and a small number of outlier peaks

### Results Analysis

- **The two axes were well balanced during stable guiding**: RA RMS was 0.43″ and Dec RMS was 0.50″, with only a small difference between the axes and no clear indication of sustained single-axis oscillation. The total RMS of 0.66″ corresponds to approximately 0.22 guide-camera pixels at 2.99″/px, including approximately 0.14 px in RA and 0.17 px in Dec
- **The higher RMS in the complete log was driven mainly by transient Dec deviations**: The complete-log RA RMS was 0.45″, which is close to the stable interval and indicates broadly consistent long-duration RA behavior. Dec RMS increased to 0.82″, suggesting that dither, settling, the light breeze, or a small number of outlier peaks mainly affected the Dec statistics. It does not mean that Dec continuously tracked at an error of 0.82″ during stable operation
- **Stable guiding was maintained under an actual payload of approximately 13 kg**: With the fully modified Sky-Watcher BKP 150/750, Nikon D7000, MPCC, and guide system installed, the stable interval showed no obvious divergence or sustained mechanical oscillation. This indicates that the present structural rigidity, transmission control, and guiding response are sufficient for practical imaging with this tested setup
- **The 0.2 s guide exposure demonstrates fast correction response**: A short exposure can respond quickly to tracking deviations, but it is also more sensitive to seeing and brief disturbances. The observed 0.4″ to 0.6″ range should therefore be treated as a measured result for this specific equipment, parameter set, and environment rather than a fixed value for every operating condition
- **The frequency-domain result is not a direct measurement of intrinsic periodic error**: The selected low-frequency component had a period of approximately 2206.6 s and a displayed amplitude of approximately 0.1″. Because the data came from a closed-loop guiding log containing low-frequency drift, dither, and settling, the result can only be used to inspect frequency components and cannot be identified directly as the intrinsic periodic error of the harmonic reducer

The curve with RA guide corrections removed still contains low-frequency drift, dither, and settling effects. Its full peak-to-peak range must not be treated as the intrinsic periodic error of the harmonic reducer

In the frequency analysis, the selected low-frequency component has a period of approximately 2206.6 s and a displayed amplitude of approximately 0.1″. This result is useful only for inspecting frequency components and does not replace a long unguided periodic-error test with guide corrections and dithering disabled

## 🔌Electronics Overview

The control system features a completely custom design, built around a compact architecture, and includes:

*   **An ESP32-WROOM-32UE16N-based main control core**, running the powerful [OnStep/OnStepX](https://onstep.groups.io/g/main/wiki) system.
*   **Integrated ESP07S wireless connectivity**, providing efficient wireless and wired communication capabilities.
*   **TMC-series stepper motor drivers**, enabling precise, silent microstepping control and pointing for both Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) axes.
*   **An efficient power management solution**, featuring an onboard TPS5450 buck converter module and AMS1117 LDO voltage regulator chips to ensure clean and stable system voltage, even under heavy loads.
*   Integrated interfaces for **home sensors and limit switches**, ensuring device safety during operation.
*   Support for remote control via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB routing, allowing for seamless integration with mainstream astrophotography software ecosystems (N.I.N.A., INDI, ASCOM, etc.).
*   The control board's PCB layout is designed with future expandability in mind; using jumpers located next to the main board's driver slots, you can easily physically switch between the advanced **SPI Smart Control Mode** and the traditional **STEP/DIR Independent Mode** (firmware reflashing is required after switching modes).

*   **TMC5160 SPI Mode (Recommended Configuration) 🚀**
*   **Hardware Setup:** Use jumper caps to bridge the dedicated SPI pin headers, directly connecting the ESP32's SPI bus to the TMC5160 drivers.
*   **System Advantages:** Completely eliminates the need for manual potentiometer adjustment, allowing the OnStep firmware to directly read from and write to the driver registers. You can configure run/hold currents and precisely set microstepping resolutions in real-time—either via the web interface or within `Config.h`—and intelligently switch between StealthChop (ultra-silent operation) and SpreadCycle (high dynamic torque) modes to maximize the performance of the harmonic drive reducer.
*   **Firmware Integration:** Within `Config.h`... The RA/Dec drive model is defined as `TMC5160_SPI`.

* **Traditional STEP/DIR Mode (Backward Compatible) 🔌**
* **Hardware Setup:** Disconnect the SPI communication jumpers.
* **Use Case:** Serves as a reliable low-level fallback solution. If you need to temporarily substitute standard A4988 or DRV8825 drivers, or if you choose to utilize the "Standalone" mode of the TMC drivers, this design offers exceptional hardware fault tolerance and ease of maintenance.
* **Firmware Integration:** You must precisely enter the microstep values—as configured via jumper caps—into the `Config.h` file. Furthermore, you **must manually use a multimeter and a ceramic screwdriver** to adjust the VREF potentiometer on the driver board to set the motor current.

> 💡**Warning: Before inserting or removing driver modules, or altering jumper settings, you must completely disconnect the system's main power supply (including USB power) to prevent transient voltage surges from damaging the TMC5160 drivers or the ESP32 microcontroller.**

All circuit schematics and PCB layouts—which feature strictly controlled safety clearances, via dimensions, and high-current trace widths—were designed using open-source tools. You can order the PCBs directly from [JLC PCB](https://member.jlc.com/?spm=PCB.Homepage) or modify the designs to suit your specific requirements.
