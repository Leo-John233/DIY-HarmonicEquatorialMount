## ⚙️ Phase Two: Mechanical Structure Assembly

### 1. Harmonic Reducer Installation (RA/DEC Axis)
In this step, we will install the core components of the equatorial mount. Considering the stress requirements of the radial slow-speed rotating load, please ensure that the flange contact surfaces are flat and in close contact during installation.

1. Precisely align the reducer flange face with the screw holes on the aluminum plate, making the center through hole of the aluminum plate as coaxial as possible with the hollow shaft of the reducer. Use hex socket head cap screws and tighten them evenly in a diagonal sequence to ensure uniform stress on the reducer housing and avoid deformation caused by excessive tightness or vibration caused by excessive looseness.
2. Two screw holes require longer screws, and lock nuts are not needed for subsequent motor mount installation.
3. Four screw holes do not require screws for subsequent installation of the 3D-printed reducer protective cover.
4. Tighten the excess parts of the remaining core screw components (excluding those from step 2) into lock nuts to ensure a secure connection between the reducer and the aluminum plate that will not loosen due to vibration.

### 2. Transmission Assembly

1. Install the machined 80-gear 2GT idler wheel onto the input shaft of the reducer, ensuring the idler wheel is coaxial with the input shaft. Use Allen screws and tighten them evenly in a diagonal sequence to ensure a secure connection that will not loosen due to vibration.
2. Install the 20-gear 2GT idler wheel onto the output shaft of the stepper motor.
3. Mount the stepper motor onto the motor mount using copper pillars.
4. **Power-off Brake Installation**: Replace the original motor screws at the tail end of the dual-output-axis stepper motor used for the RA axis and install an electromagnetic brake module. This effectively prevents damage to the telescope's "head" due to counterweight imbalance during unexpected power outages.
5. Place a 2GT 10mm wide synchronous belt onto the motor idler wheel beforehand for easier subsequent installation.

### 3. Assembly of RA Axis Latitude Seat Flange
1. 1. Connect the RA shaft flange to connecting shafts A and B using hex socket screws.
2. During step 1, simultaneously assemble the push rod and push block structure, ensuring the push rod can slide smoothly within the push block, and that connecting shafts A and B can achieve relative movement via the push rod.
3. Install the assembled structure from steps 1 and 2 onto the flange of the harmonic reducer using hex socket screws. Simultaneously install the 3D-printed reducer protective cover during the installation process.

### 4. Connection of Motor, Synchronous Belt and Reducer, and Installation of Sensor and Flange

1. Install the motor onto the longer screws pre-drilled on the aluminum plate in step 1 through the pre-drilled holes on the motor mount. Tighten the synchronous belt and tighten the anti-loosening nuts on the screws to ensure that the synchronous belt does not slip or become excessively loose during transmission.
2. Adjust the height of the idler pulley on the motor output shaft appropriately so that it is on the same horizontal plane as the idler pulley on the reducer input shaft. This ensures even tension distribution of the synchronous belt and avoids excessive wear or reduced transmission efficiency due to non-parallelism.
3. After completing the above steps, manually rotate the large idler pulley to check if the synchronous belt runs smoothly and ensure there are no abnormal friction sounds or vibrations. This will help confirm the correct installation and adjustment of the transmission system.
4. After installation, it is recommended to spray an appropriate amount of silicone lubricant on the synchronous belt to reduce friction and abnormal noise and extend the service life of the synchronous belt.
5. Install the photoelectric sensor limit switches and origin switches on the RA/DEC shafts to ensure that their positions can accurately detect the extreme positions and origin positions of the shaft for safety protection and precise positioning.
6. Install the 3D-printed reducer protective cover on the outside of the reducer, using the pre-drilled screw holes and hex socket screws for fixing. This ensures that the protective cover can effectively prevent dust and debris from entering the reducer without interfering with its normal operation.
7. Install the flange of the RA/DEC shaft, ensuring it is coaxial with the shaft, and tighten it evenly with Allen screws to ensure the flange does not shift or loosen during operation.

### 5. Housing Assembly
1. Connect the assembled RA and DEC axes mechanical structures using aluminum blocks. Utilize a marble-like horizontal surface to ensure all aluminum plates are installed perpendicularly and orthogonally without interference.
2. Apply an appropriate amount of screw glue to the screw connections to ensure the stability and reliability of the mechanical connections during equipment operation.

## ⚡ Phase Three: Electrical Control Assembly and Wiring

### 1. PCB Base Plate and Driver Installation

1. Fix the assembled PCB board inside the electrical control compartment using copper pillars. During installation, carefully check the 12V/24V high-current power supply plane on the back to ensure sufficient insulation distance between it and the metal casing. 2. Connect the TMC5160 driver module and the ESP32 main control board to the corresponding female connectors in sequence, carefully checking the pin orientation to ensure they are correctly connected.

### 2. Standard Wiring and Cable Management To ensure the absolute stability of the equipment in outdoor environments and under high current driving conditions, the wiring in this project has strict requirements:

1. The main power supply line must use standard **power switch leads** to connect to the PCB. **The use of any arbitrary "flying wires"** as a substitute for the power path is strictly prohibited.
2. Connect the control cables for the RA and DEC axis stepper motors to the corresponding terminals on the TMC5160.
3. Connect the control cables for the power-off protection system and tidy up all wiring harnesses to ensure that the cables do not become tangled or excessively stretched during the equatorial mount's extreme rotation.

## 💻 Phase Four: Firmware Configuration and Initial Debugging

The equatorial mount's hardware logic is designed specifically for the standard OnStep environment.

1. **Firmware Selection**: The system runs **standard OnStep firmware** (⚠️Please note: This project **does not apply** OnStepX; do not flash the wrong firmware version).
2. **Communication Confirmation**: Ensure the ESP32 pin mapping matches your modified OnStep firmware, and confirm the ESP07S's network communication connection is normal. 3. **Power-on Self-Test:** Connect to power and test whether the electromagnetic brake can engage/release normally. Monitor the operating status and microstepping settings of the TMC5160 via the host computer.
